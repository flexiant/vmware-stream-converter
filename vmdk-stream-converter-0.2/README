While adding support for VMWare ESX/vSphere to the Image Factory project
we discovered that we needed to support the "stream-optimized" variant
of VMDK.

This module is a first draft attempt to do so.

It is known to work on ESXi 4.1.

This format is only useful if you are attempting to import virtual machines
into ESX using the vSphere SOAP API and HTTP POST uploads of image files.
(In which case, it is required.)

More details about the Image Factory and the rest of the aeolus project
can be found here:
